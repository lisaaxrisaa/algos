// When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.

// Examples

// cigarParty(30, false) → false
// cigarParty(50, false) → true
// cigarParty(70, true) → true

// You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes.

With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

// Examples

// dateFashion(5, 10) → 2
// dateFashion(5, 2) → 0

// The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive). Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. Given an int temperature and a boolean isSummer, return true if the squirrels play and false otherwise.

// Examples

// squirrelPlay(95, true) → true

Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

// Examples

// caughtSpeeding(60, false) → 0
// caughtSpeeding(65, false) → 1
// caughtSpeeding(65, true) → 0
